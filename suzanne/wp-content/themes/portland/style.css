Theme Name: Suzanne Childress Design
Theme URI: http://tidythemes.com/blankslate/
Description: 3.0+ has been completely and massively overhauled. DO NOT UPGRADE current projects to this version automatically. You will lose all customizations whether you're using a child theme or not. BEFORE USING AND ESPECIALLY UPGRADING IN GENERAL PLEASE READ: tidythemes.com/concept. The bare essentials of a WordPress theme (an HTML5 boilerplate), no visual CSS styles added. Perfect for those who would like to build their own theme from scratch or for clients if you're a developer or designer. This theme is clean, valid code, semi minified, no programmer comments, SEO-friendly and 100% open source. One custom menu and one widgetized sidebar to get you started. If you don't know CSS and would like to learn we've prepared: tidythemes.com/want-to-learn-css and please visit us in the forum for further help: tidythemes.com/forum - Thank You and Enjoy
